Speed!
=====

Minimalistic speed meter app.

This example app shows how to read GPS data. We show speed, in km/h (sorry imperial people, but this is what I need), but you can use the rest too.

This app was inspired by Finnish Traffic police and their automated speed monitoring system - and a certain speed ticket, small enough that it is not worth complaining that the road signs were completelly covered by snow, while the camera lense was, obviously, clean; but still high enough to inspire me to make this application and write these lines. 

It would be interesting to know if there are more road cameras or residents in the whole Lapland province.
